# The Fast Supper

[The Fast Supper](https://github.com/richardreiter/the-fast-supper) is a blog website dedicated to provide more information regarding fasting and its health benefits.

The website is targeted at people who are curious about fasting, so these like-minded people can learn more about it, and engage, commenting on the blog posts.
